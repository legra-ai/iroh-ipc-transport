//! Portable local datagrams as a native iroh QUIC path.
//!
//! macOS uses IPv4 loopback UDP, Linux uses Unix datagrams, and Windows uses
//! local message-mode named pipes. Callers use the same [`LocalDiscovery`] and
//! [`IpcTransport`] API on every platform. QUIC provides authentication, stream
//! multiplexing, reliability and congestion control on each backend.
//!
//! Prepare the transport asynchronously, add it to the iroh builder, and install
//! [`PreferIpcTransport`]. Resolve co-located peers through [`LocalDiscovery`].
//! After `iroh::Endpoint::close().await`, call [`IpcTransport::close`] to release
//! the transport and its discovery lease. Dropping the final handle also
//! schedules cleanup; a process crash leaves an unlocked, undiscoverable record
//! that the next owner can reclaim without probing any socket.
